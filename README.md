# Calculus: Sequence, Series and their Application with Python

I’m excited to share my new book on Calculus, which explores the fundamental concepts of series and sequences and their powerful applications in advanced mathematical analysis.

The book covers:

🔹 The foundations of sequences and series

🔹 Applications to Taylor Series and Fourier Series

🔹 Numerical approaches for solving nonlinear functions

🔹 Practical Python implementations for better visualization and understanding

Each chapter includes a range of problems from beginner to advanced level, with detailed solutions provided to support self-study and deeper comprehension.

🎯 Purpose: To help students not only master the fundamentals of calculus but also apply these concepts to complex mathematical and computational problems through practical examples.
